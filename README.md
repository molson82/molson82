Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Molson. I am an experienced full stack Software Engineer with an active history of working in the cloud/web industry. Skilled in JavaScript, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node, Golang, Java, HTML/CSS, and Scrum. I obtained my Bachelor of Science - BS focused on Computer and Information Technology from Purdue University.

All of that to say that I love programming and developing, not only for my full-time job but also on the side for my personal projects. I have many projects that I am constantly working on either by myself or with colleagues and or friends.

If you wish, you can check out my full Dev Blog at https://dev.to/molson82. Or, you can read the T.L.D.R for each of my posts right here.

### [Post 1 - Intro](https://dev.to/molson82/molson-s-dev-blog-intro-2b05)
My name is Molson and I am a full-time full-stack software engineer. I have taken it upon myself to start a Dev Blog where I will share my updates on my current projects, ideas I have, cool products or tools I find that I think will be helpful for others, and any other things that pop into my head.

I want this blog to be a place for me to grow both as a writer and a developer, and learn from others so that I can improve how I code. Or occasionally post images of my dog Nova ðŸ˜„.
